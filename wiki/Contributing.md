## Adding a New Cat

The most popular way to contribute is by adding a new ASCII cat to the collection. Here's how:

### Step 1: Fork the Repository

1. Visit the [ascii-cats repository](https://github.com/altx-labs/ascii-cats)
2. Click the "Fork" button in the top-right corner
3. Clone your forked repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/ascii-cats.git
   cd ascii-cats
   ```

### Step 2: Create a New Branch

Create a branch for your changes:

```bash
git checkout -b add-new-cat-name
```

### Step 3: Add Your Cat

Open the `cats.json` file and add your new cat:

```json
{
  "existing-cat": [
    "line 1",
    "line 2"
  ],
  
  "your-new-cat": [
    "  /\\___/\\",
    " /       \\",
    "| o     o |",
    " \\_  âˆ§  _/",
    "   | | |",
    "  (__|__)"
  ]
}
```

Guidelines for cat design:

1. Choose a descriptive, unique name for your cat
2. Make sure each line is properly escaped (especially backslashes)
3. Keep the design reasonably sized (typically under 25 lines)
4. Test that your cat displays correctly in a terminal

### Step 4: Test Your Changes

Run the tests to make sure everything works:

```bash
npm test
```

Also, test your new cat manually:

```bash
node cmd.js your-new-cat
```

### Step 5: Commit and Push

Commit your changes with a descriptive message:

```bash
git add cats.json
git commit -m "feat: add your-new-cat design"
git push origin add-new-cat-name
```

### Step 6: Create a Pull Request

1. Go to your fork on GitHub
2. Click "New Pull Request"
3. Select your branch and provide a description of your changes
4. Submit the pull request
