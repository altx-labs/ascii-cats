ascii-cats is a lightweight Node.js library and CLI tool that provides a collection of ASCII art cats. It's designed to be simple, fun, and easy to use, whether you're adding some feline charm to your terminal applications or just having fun with ASCII art.

The library allows you to:

- Display random ASCII cats
- Request specific cats by name
- List all available cat names
- Use cats in both programmatic and CLI contexts
